/**
 * The uBITX is an upconnversion transceiver. The first IF is at 45 MHz.
 * The first IF frequency is not exactly at 45 Mhz but about 5 khz lower,
 * this shift is due to the loading on the 45 Mhz crystal filter by the matching
 * L-network used on it's either sides.
 * The first oscillator works between 48 Mhz and 75 MHz. The signal is subtracted
 * from the first oscillator to arriive at 45 Mhz IF. Thus, it is inverted : LSB becomes USB
 * and USB becomes LSB.
 * The second IF of 12 Mhz has a ladder crystal filter. If a second oscillator is used at
 * 57 Mhz, the signal is subtracted FROM the oscillator, inverting a second time, and arrives
 * at the 12 Mhz ladder filter thus doouble inversion, keeps the sidebands as they originally were.
 * If the second oscillator is at 33 Mhz, the oscilaltor is subtracated from the signal,
 * thus keeping the signal's sidebands inverted. The USB will become LSB.
 * We use this technique to switch sidebands. This is to avoid placing the lsbCarrier close to
 * 12 MHz where its fifth harmonic beats with the arduino's 16 Mhz oscillator's fourth harmonic

 *  The second set of 16 pins on the Raduino's bottom connector are have the three clock outputs and the digital lines to control the rig.
 *  This assignment is as follows :
 *    Pin   1   2    3    4    5    6    7    8    9    10   11   12   13   14   15   16
 *         GND +5V CLK0  GND  GND  CLK1 GND  GND  CLK2  GND  D2   D3   D4   D5   D6   D7
 *  These too are flexible with what you may do with them, for the Raduino, we use them to :
 *  - TX_RX line : Switches between Transmit and Receive after sensing the PTT or the morse keyer
 *  - CW_KEY line : turns on the carrier for CW

/**
 * We need to carefully pick assignment of pin for various purposes.
 * There are two sets of completely programmable pins on the Raduino.
 * First, on the top of the board, in line with the LCD connector is an 8-pin connector
 * that is largely meant for analog inputs and front-panel control. It has a regulated 5v output,
 * ground and six pins. Each of these six pins can be individually programmed
 * either as an analog input, a digital input or a digital output.
 * The pins are assigned as follows (left to right, display facing you):
 *      Pin 1 (Violet), A7, SPARE
 *      Pin 2 (Blue),   A6, KEYER (DATA)
 *      Pin 3 (Green), +5v
 *      Pin 4 (Yellow), Gnd
 *      Pin 5 (Orange), A3, PTT
 *      Pin 6 (Red),    A2, F BUTTON
 *      Pin 7 (Brown),  A1, ENC B
 *      Pin 8 (Black),  A0, ENC A
 *Note: A5, A4 are wired to the Si5351 as I2C interface
 *       *
 * Though, this can be assigned anyway, for this application of the Arduino, we will make the following
 * assignment
 * A2 will connect to the PTT line, which is the usually a part of the mic connector
 * A3 is connected to a push button that can momentarily ground this line. This will be used for RIT/Bandswitching, etc.
 * A6 is to implement a keyer, it is reserved and not yet implemented
 * A7 is connected to a center pin of good quality 100K or 10K linear potentiometer with the two other ends connected to
 * ground and +5v lines available on the connector. This implments the tuning mechanism
